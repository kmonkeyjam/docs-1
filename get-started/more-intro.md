## What is Transposit?

Transposit is an end-to-end solution for building real, production-ready applications on top of APIs. With Transposit's relational engine, you can use SQL and Javascript to join, filter and transform your data, wherever it lives, in an interactive interface. Transposit will deal with complexities of authentication, retries, caching, and optimized execution for you. Your application can interact with Transposit through our JavaScript client or plain 'ol HTTP.

Transposit is an end-to-end solution for building real, production-ready applications on top of APIs. We give you the power of a relational engine to join, filter and transform your data, wherever it lives, in an interactive interface. Transposit will deal with authentication, retries, caching, and optimized execution for you.

### Relational engine

Transposit is a relational engine that allows you to compose the APIs you need to build your application in a powerful interface. You can write SQL or JavaScript to interactively join, filter and transform application data in Transposit without worrying about the shape of that data, authentication, or pagination -- the stuff that usually makes working with APIs painful.

### The power of managed auth

Transposit provides a vertically integrated authentication solution that saves you from writing the. We not only handle your basic user login, but

### Log actions, not events

With Transposit, all the information you'd need to reproduce and issue is already there when things break, by default. By logging actions and their context, not events, we give you the recipe instead of the breadcrumbs so you don't need to work backwards when things go wrong.

### **Modern tooling**

Aside from our keystone features, Transposit provides the features you'd expect of a first-class developer tool, including a standard interface with smart treatments of APIs, pagination, serverless functions, caching, and basic application hosting.

### Developer-first philosophy

We are developers, and we built Transposit with developers' needs in mind. That's why Transpost is:

* **Incrementally adoptable:** Transposit is a library, not an ecosystem. You can use Transposit to build a single endpoint, or as your entire backend.
* **Based on modern tooling and open standards:** We take advantage of the battle-tested tools and libraries you already know and love, like xyz.
* **Backed by git:**
* **Free to try:** You can start using Transposit without speaking to a single person. No need to pay for anything until your applications or endpoints start to see a lot of traffic.
